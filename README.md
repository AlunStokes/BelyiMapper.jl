# BelyiMapper.jl
## 🔥❗🚨 __This is a work in progress__ 🚨❗🔥

Currently, it is possible to generically solve for all Belyi maps (using homotopy continuation) for a given genus 0 dessin d'enfant passport and normalisation. Sometimes it can do higher genera. This version (a pre-release to a versin to come around May 2023) makes stock usage of the brilliant [HomotopyContinuation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHomotopyContinuation/HomotopyContinuation.jl) from [Sascha Timme](https://www.saschatimme.com/about) and [Paul Breiding](https://pbrdng.github.io/index.html). With the expected publication of my thesis will come a version maing specific optimisation to solving Belyi maps --- making particular use of intrinsic properties of the systems that arise as a result (in particular targetting the mixed volumne calculations. Should little of this jargon make sense to you then idk go read a thesis (there are literally hundereds) it's very interesting stuff.
